# NobleSword

# Background

This project is a 2D fighting game that can be played with 1 or 2 players. The two characters will be able to fight each other. The conditions for victory are that, the character with the most health after the timer runs out wins, or the player that gets knocked out loses. The characters will be able to use light/heavy attacks and block incoming attacks. 

# Functionality

In NobleSword players will be able to:
  * attack the other player/ai
  * block incoming attacks from the opponent
  * move left, right, jump and crouch
  * select different characters
